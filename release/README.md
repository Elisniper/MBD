# About MBD

MBD is a dark blue material theme for Discord. MBD tries to stay as low as possible in using hardware resources while also delivering a smooth experience. I will try and provide Updates/Bug fixes as soon as possible when discord updates occur.

# Installation

1. Download the theme [here](https://betterdiscord.app/Download?id=746)
2. Place the 'Material Blue Discord.theme.css' file into the BetterDiscord themes folder.
3. Enable the theme in the themes tab.

# Plugin Support
MBD does not actively support all plugins and does not seek out theme fixes for every plugin out there. However, I try to stay as compatible as possible. (If an issue is found please create an issue on the GitHub Repo or reach out for some help in the BetterDiscord server.)
